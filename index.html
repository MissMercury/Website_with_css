      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="profile">I did my thesis at the functional biology lab at the KU Leuven. Here I worked with bacteria and yeast
        (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and used a broad range of techniques including PCR, genetical manipulation of yeast,
        cloning, and western blot. I really enjoyed my time here and I was passionate about the research. After this,
        I started working at the Stem cell institute at the KU Leuven. Here I had the opportunity to have the freedom to
        plan experiments and I had the chance to broaden my knowledge in cell culture, molecular biology, animal
        experiments, data analysis etc. During this last year, I moved to the University of Edinburgh. Here I started working with
        yeast again. Here, I got the chance of using my programming skills .I have more than eight years of experience in the
        academic world, working with master students, PhD students and post- docs.</p>

          <h3>Laboratory skills</h3>
          <p>
            In the more than eight years I spent in the lab, I learned a lot of different techniques. Here are some of them: <br><br>
            <b>Cell culture:</b> yeast, bacterial, transformation, cloning, growthcurve, viral, mammalian, Primary cell line, Single cell isolation, FACS sorting, iPSC<br/>
            <b>Animal In Vivo experiments:</b> injections, dissections, conventional and SPF management<br/>
            <b>Animal Ex Vivo experiments:</b> cryosectioning, microtome, muscle strength measuring system<br/>
            <b>Staining:</b> Histological and immunofluorescent staining<br/>
            <b>Imaging:</b> Bright field and fluorescent microscopy, Bioluminescent imaging<br/>
            <b>Molecular biology:</b> Plasmid, RNA, DNA and protein extraction, PCR, qRT-PCR, Western Blot, SmartSeq2, RNASeq, Elisa<br/>
            <b>Data Analysis:</b> Sequencing, FACS, bioinformatics<br/>
            <b>Training:</b> bachelor, master and PhD students

          <h3>Data science and programming</h3>
          <p>
            During the last three years a lot of analysis were needed on big data. Since the tools which were available couldn't handle this,
            I started studying and using programming and data science in both R and Python3. <br>
            In my free time, I also started learning SQL, iOS app development with Swift5 and web design, both front-end and back-end.
